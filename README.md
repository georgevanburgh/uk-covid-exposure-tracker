# uk-covid-exposure-tracking

This repo contained a project to track the numbers of exposure keys released by the [UK NHS COVID-19 app](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-covid-19-app). The [key distribution endpoint](https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/exposure-key-file-format#file-format) was scraped every day whilst the app was active. No information about individual exposure keys was stored, simply the count of keys available.

The NHS shut down the COVID 19 app on 27 April 2023, and as such this repository will no longer be updated.
